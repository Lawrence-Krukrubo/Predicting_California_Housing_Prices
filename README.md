# Predicting_California_Housing_Prices
Hard-coding a Neural Network from scratch to Predict California Housing Prices...

I shall write codes from scratch to build a Multi-Layer Deep Neural Network using python and use it to predict the price of houses in california. Each hidden layer will have the Linear-Relu Activation Function and the output layer will have the Relu activation function.

The **Universal Function Approximation Theorem** states that a neural network with a single hidden layer and a finite number of neurons can approximate continous functions on compact subsets of data points in hyper-dimensional vector spaces, under mild assumptions of the activation function.

This means a Neural Network with just one hidden layer is enough to represent any function. But because I want the Neural Network to learn the best parameters to predict the housing prices, I will build it with multiple hidden layers respectively.
